Cardizer is a credit card randomizer to test application.

Keep in mind that all credit card numbers generated with Cardizer are completely random and do not hold any real life value.

## Features

* Easy to use
* Easy to extend
* Thread safe
* Check with the Luhn's algorithm
* Support for Visa credit card
* Support for Jcb credit card
* Support for Amex credit card
* Support for Discover credit card
* Support for MasterCard credit card

## Getting Started

Install the [Dedge.Cardizer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dedge.Cardizer) NuGet package:

    PM> Install-Package Dedge.Cardizer

Alternatively you can also use the .NET CLI to add the packages:

    dotnet add package Dedge.Cardizer

Next create a .net application and use Dedge.Cardizer:

```fsharp
open System

[<EntryPoint>]
let main _ =
    Dedge.Cardizer.NextVisa () |> printfn "Visa: %s"
    0
```

or in C#:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var card = Dedge.Cardizer.NextVisa();
    Console.WriteLine(card);
}
```

output:

    Visa: 4127540509730813

Of course the credit card value is going to be randomized.
