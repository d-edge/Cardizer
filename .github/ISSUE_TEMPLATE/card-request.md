<!-- Replace Dankort with the card you want -->
<!--Fill the table as per the wiki link or any other valid soure-->

Hello,

I would like to be able to generate randomize valid Dankort card.

| Issuing network | IIN ranges | Active | Length |  Validation |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Dankort | 5019 | Yes | 16 | Luhn |
